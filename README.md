Stopwatch

This project is a simple and interactive Stopwatch application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to start, pause, reset, and record lap times with a clean and responsive user interface. The stopwatch displays time in minutes, seconds, and centiseconds, with a lap feature to track split times.
